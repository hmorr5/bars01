Purpose:

To create a simple program to get the live prices of ores and bars and any required materials 
for the process of smelting. Also showing the profits/loss if made using smelters/superheating etc.




The user has the option to select a bar type and what method of smelting. Then the pprogram identifies how much 
coal is needed, the price of all the materials if bought (from the constantly updated G.E) and the profits/Losses.


As a side part, not really needed but cool to add, The user can get information about bars, or a list of all the bar 
prices. Also what is needed to smelt the bars, so coal if needed or not. As well as xp amounts from smelting/superheating.
Some for of data update button should probs be included.
